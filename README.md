# To-Do-List-Application
  A full-stack To-Do List app built with Node.js, PostgreSQL, EJS, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add, edit, and delete tasks. The back-end manages task data and CRUD operations, while the front-end dynamically displays tasks and allows for real-time updates and interaction, offering a seamless user experience.

# Back-End Development:
  The back-end of the application is powered by Node.js, allowing for efficient handling of server requests and task data management. Using PostgreSQL, the app stores tasks in a relational database, allowing users to manage task information persistently. The server is responsible for managing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, ensuring tasks can be added, retrieved, edited, and deleted as needed.

# Front-End Development:
  The front-end is built using EJS, which allows the dynamic rendering of task data from the back-end, providing users with an interactive and real-time experience. The interface is simple, clean, and easy to use, allowing users to enter new tasks, edit existing ones, or delete them. CSS is used to style the user interface, making it responsive and accessible across different screen sizes and devices.

JavaScript Interactivity:
  To enhance the user experience, JavaScript is used for handling task editing, enabling users to directly modify task details in the interface without page reloads. This makes the application more interactive and user-friendly.

# Key Features:
  Add new tasks with a title and description.
  
  Edit existing tasks directly in the interface.
  
  Delete tasks as needed.
  
  Real-time updates and smooth interaction across the platform.
